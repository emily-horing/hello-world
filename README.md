Learning how to use Github!

My name is Emily and I am learning what the heck is Github. It is pretty easy to get Github and Git confused as it turns out! This exercise is to make it easier for me to understand what's the big deal here.

I work at Cockroach labs on Product Ops. Doing this will help me manage our release cycle, which is moderated here in Github by our very talented engineers and PMs.

Danish is my favorite language. Hej verden!
